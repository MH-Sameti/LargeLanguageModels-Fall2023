        "The advent of Large Language Models (LLMs) has undeniably shifted the paradigm in the realm of natural language processing, offering capabilities that inch closer to human-like text understanding and generation. Among the vanguards of this shift is the Llama-2 model, a behemoth trained on diverse text corpora, promising adeptness in various NLP tasks. However, as we usher into this era of seemingly intelligent machines, a pertinent question arises - do these models truly understand the text, or do they merely excel in retrieving memorized pieces of information from their training data? This inquiry is not merely academic; the implications of the findings reverberate through the practical applications and the future trajectory of LLMs. In exploring the reasoning capabilities of Large Language Models, a noteworthy investigation was carried out by [Saparov and He](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=qFVVBzXxR2V). Their analytical journey led to the revelation that these models, to a significant extent, harness the knowledge acquired during the pre-training phase when confronted with reasoning tasks. Characterized as \"greedy reasoners,\" these models exhibit a propensity to rely on the reservoir of memorized information, as opposed to showcasing authentic reasoning abilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "Our exploration is set against the backdrop of the SQuAD dataset, a well-regarded benchmark in the question-answering domain. The choice of SQuAD is motivated by its structured evaluation metrics which offer a tangible measure of a model's ability to retrieve and reason over text. While SQuAD has been instrumental in driving progress in question answering, its conventional usage may not fully expose the nuanced capabilities of models like Llama-2. This homework aims to delve deeper by constructing adversarial datasets that challenge the model beyond mere retrieval, probing its ability to reason and refer to the provided context accurately. Through a systematic evaluation on both the original and adversarially-modified versions of the SQuAD dataset, we aspire to dissect the retrieval and reasoning prowess of Llama-2, shedding light on the model's strengths, weaknesses, and the path towards more robust and interpretable LLMs.\n",

The objective is to scrutinize how the model responds to scenarios that are crafted to challenge its reasoning and retrieval capacities. We propose three methods to create adversarial datasets, each aimed at examining different facets of the model's behavior.\n",

For instance, changing the context from \"The president of the USA lives in the White House. Barack Obama is the current president of the USA.\" to \"The president of the USA lives in the White House. Gall Granuaile is the current president of the USA.\" and observing if the answer changes appropriately.\n",
